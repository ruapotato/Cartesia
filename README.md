# Cartesia - 2D Voxel Adventure Game

A Starbound/Terraria-style 2D sandbox game with procedural generation,
crafting, mining, and exploration.

## Quick Start

### Run the Modern Version (Recommended):
```bash
source pyenv/bin/activate
python play_v2.py
```

### Run the Legacy Version:
```bash
source pyenv/bin/activate
./main.py
```

## Features

### Starbound-Style Physics
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Variable jump height (hold jump = higher)
- Coyote time (grace period for jumping)
- Jump buffering (forgiving input timing)
- Auto-climbing (step up single blocks)
- Wall sliding
- Fast falling (release jump early)

### Core Gameplay
- **Mining** - Progressive damage with tool requirements
- **Building** - Place blocks to construct
- **Inventory** - Hotbar + main storage
- **Tools** - Durability system for pickaxes, axes, shovels
- **Crafting** - Combine items (coming soon)
- **Farming** - Plant and harvest crops (coming soon)

### Controls
- **A/D or Arrows** - Move
- **Space/W/Up** - Jump (hold for higher!)
- **Left Click** - Mine blocks
- **Right Click** - Place blocks
- **1-9** - Select hotbar slot
- **ESC** - Quit
